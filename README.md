# Auto FileOrganizer
Automatically organize your files with the help of LLMs.
All you have to do is to write a simple yaml file as such:

```yaml
folders:
  - media:
    - img: "all images"
    - video: "all videos"
  - dev: "all dev files"
  - docs:
    - academic: "all academic docs"
    - legal: "all legal docs"
```
